# Investigating LMX1B Mutations in NPS Using Patient-Derived Organoids

### Research Goal  
Identify dysregulated miRNA profiles in Nail-Patella Syndrome (NPS) patient-derived 3D testicular organoids to:  
- Discover novel biomarkers for NPS severity  
- Develop targeted differentiation protocols for regenerative therapies  

### Key Components  
1. **Genetic Analysis**: Pathogenic LMX1B variants from ClinVar ([Example Data](data/nps_genetic_variants.csv))  
2. **Organoid Models**: Compare WT vs. NPS miRNA profiles (Nanostring data)  
3. **Drug Screening**: AI-predicted compounds to restore normal spermatogenesis
